# Introduction

One of the founding principles of Axyl Projects is to lead. We are willing to be the first, we are willing
to be the risk takers, and we are willing to be the ones who are blamed when things go wrong. This is because our
goals are those of a progressive group tied to a staunch conservative leadership, and we know that the advancement
of open source software will be what keeps the world alive in the future.

# What we believe in:
